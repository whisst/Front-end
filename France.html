		<p class="text-style">
			<strong>Normandy</strong>, in northern France, is one of the most visited regions of France by foreigners. And for a reason! Normandy offers the visitor a stunning coastline, picturesque small towns, and idyllic countryside. Normandy is a popular weekend getaway from Paris, and many hotels and restaurants thrive in Normandy, especially around the town of Deauville or Honfleur.<br><br>
			The impressionist movement was born in Normandy, inspired by Monet’s “Impression” of the sunrise at Le Havre.<br><br>
			Normandy is also famous for its rich history, its tower bells, cows, and cheese.<br><br>
			Explore Normandy’s D-Day Landing Beaches, be amazed by the Étretat or Fécamp cliffs, admire unique Mont Saint Michel, or follow Richard Lionheart’s steps.

		<h2>Centre-Val de Loire</h2>
		<p class="text-style">The region of <strong>Centre-Val-de-Loire</strong>, in central France, gets its name from the Loire River, the longest river in France. Irrigated by the Loire and its many tributaries, the valley of Loire produces excellent wines perfectly complemented with savorous terroirs.<br><br>

		Beloved by Kings, Queens, and artists, Centre-Val-de-Loire is also the cradle of the Renaissance in France and world-famous thanks to its amazing Châteaux de la Loire and their remarkable gardens that line the river. Les Châteaux de La Loire are today one of the most popular tourist attractions in France.<br><br>

		Centre-Val-de-Loire is also popular with bike amateurs: it sees more than 1 million bikers per year!. Indeed, La Loire à Vélo (the Loire by bike) is perhaps the best way to explore this beautiful region.</p>
